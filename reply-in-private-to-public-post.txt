Hi,

you have sent me a reply in private E-mail to a public post I sent to a
mailing list, without telling me that you wish to keep the post private, and
specifying exactly why. Please see:

* http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/netiquette/email/reply-to-list.html

* http://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/#reply_to_list

Next time, please make a wise use of your E-mail client's Reply-to-all or
Reply-to-List features. (Also please note that I specifically request that you
won't reply to my public posts in private in the last line of my signature,
which is appended to all my E-mail messages.)
